	<p> When trying to build credit, it is important to not overspend. The more you spend on your card, the longer it will take to pay it off. Credit goes by time. If a card is kept for a long time, your credit history will be longer, making your credit better. If you are careful to pay on time, and more than the minimum, your credit score will increase. If a payment can be made in full, though, it may be a good idea. The most important thing to know is to NEVER max out your card; doing so can take a long time to pay off, and it will drop your credit score to near irreparable levels. Paying bills on time, never spending more than 30% of the total credit limit, and paying more than the minimum are the best tips for raising yourcredit score! </p>
